## ✨ Philosophy

This portfolio is not a résumé.  
It’s not a checklist of skills.

It’s an exploration of:
- how I think about problems
- how I design systems
- how I build interfaces that *feel right*

Every interaction, animation, and layout choice is deliberate.

---

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- **Narrative-first design** — the site unfolds like a story, not a landing page
- **Systems over screens** — flows, states, and structure before visuals
- **Minimal but meaningful motion** — animation as explanation, not decoration
- **Clarity > cleverness** — readability and intent over over-engineering

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Deployment:** Vercel

Built with performance, accessibility, and scalability in mind.

## 🎬 Structure

- **Landing (Narrator Mode)**  
  A calm, cinematic introduction that sets tone and intent.

- **Thinking in Systems**  
  Explains how I approach design and engineering decisions.

- **Proof through Work**  
  Projects and experiments that act as evidence, not claims.
